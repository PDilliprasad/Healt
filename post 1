<p>The Earth has provided us with numerous gifts, including sunlight, air, water, soil, minerals, plants, wildlife, and so on. We must keep our environment and nature clean at all times. Diseases, as well as toxic viruses and germs, are caused by a polluted environment. A clean environment is critical for keeping us healthy. The clean and green ecosystem provides us with fresh air and pollution is also reduced.</p>

<p>We can save the planet by conserving trees, natural vegetation, water, natural resources, electricity, and other resources. To control environmental pollution and global warming, we must strictly adhere to all available measures.
